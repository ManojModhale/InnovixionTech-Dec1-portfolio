# InnovixionTech-Dec1-portfolio
In this repository, I have posted all the tasks that I completed during my Web Developement internship at InnovixionTech.
<br><br>

I have completed Web Developement Internship 'Task 1', which involves creating a "Portfolio" using HTML,CSS,JavaScript & Bootstrap. I have now posted it in the repository.<br>
HTML filename = index.html<br>
CSS filename = style.css<br>
JavaScript filename = script.js<br>
this task involves too many images, so I better uploaded those all images in repository.
you have to read html code to understand which images belongs to this task.  <br>
